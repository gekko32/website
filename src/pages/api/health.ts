// `commit`/`builtAt` come from the ARG/ENV pair baked into the runtime stage of
// components/website/Dockerfile (T002202). They let an E2E run tell the code under test
// apart from the deploy it is actually hitting — without them a run against
// prod measures both at once and files tickets against bugs that do not exist
// in the repo (T002192).
//
// Both fields are ALWAYS present. Falling back to the literal 'unknown' rather
// than omitting them matters: an absent field reads as `undefined`, and a
// consumer comparing `undefined !== undefined` would conclude "no drift" at
// the exact moment the build-arg chain has broken.
