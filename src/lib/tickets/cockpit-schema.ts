// v_cockpit_rollup — leaf-count rollup per container ticket (Produkt/Feature).
// Recursive CTE walks the parent_id tree from every container down to its leaf
// tickets (type 'task'|'bug' with NO children) and aggregates status counts.
// Computed on read (no cache in MVP). Brand filtering is applied by callers,
// not the view, so the view stays a simple per-container aggregate keyed by id.
