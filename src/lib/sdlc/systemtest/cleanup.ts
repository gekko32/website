// components/website/src/lib/systemtest/cleanup.ts
//
// Background cleanup helpers for the system-test failure loop. These run on
// CronJob schedules (see k3d/cronjob-systemtest-cleanup.yaml) to keep the
// system from accumulating fixtures, expired magic-link tokens, or stuck
// outbox rows over time.
//
// Three exported functions:
//
//   - purgeFixturesFor(pool, opts)
//       Hourly fixture sweep. For each assignment that has reached a terminal
//       lifecycle state (submitted | reviewed | archived | dismissed) and is
//       older than `graceHours`, walks `questionnaire_test_fixtures` and
//       deletes the corresponding rows.
//
//   - drainOutbox(pool)
//       Every-5-minute drain of `systemtest_failure_outbox`. Picks up rows
//       whose `retry_after` has elapsed and re-tries `openFailureTicket`. On
//       success the outbox row is deleted; on failure `retry_count` is bumped
//       and `retry_after` is moved out 5 minutes. Rows hitting the 12-retry
//       budget are left in place so admins can inspect them via the board.
//
//   - purgeExpiredMagicTokens(pool)
//       Sub-helper for the hourly cron. Deletes used / expired rows from
//       `systemtest_magic_tokens`. Lives here (not in `auth/magic-link.ts`)
//       so the failure-loop cron job has a single import surface.
//
// Design constraints:
//   - Per-row failures NEVER abort the whole sweep. Each row records its
//     error in `purge_error` and we move on. The cron exits 0 unless something
//     truly catastrophic happens (e.g. pool is unreachable).
//   - Defense-in-depth on `is_test_data`: tables that have an `is_test_data`
//     column refuse to delete rows where it's false, even if a fixture row
//     somehow tracked them. Two tables (`customers`, `meetings`) do NOT have
//     that column — the seed modules created those rows exclusively for the
//     test, so deleting by id is safe. The ALLOWED_TABLES set caps the surface
//     so a stray fixture row pointing at a random table can't trigger any
//     DELETE we didn't intend.

/**
 * The full set of tables the cleanup CronJob is allowed to touch via fixture
 * rows. Anything else is treated as an unknown row type and recorded as a
 * `purge_error` so an operator can inspect.
 *
 * Notes on individual entries:
 *   - `auth.users` / `bookings.bookings` are legacy; some envs may carry them
 *     because earlier prototypes seeded them. Both have `is_test_data` columns
 *     when present (see `ensureSystemtestSchema`).
 *   - `keycloak.users` is a virtual marker (table_name kept for backward-compat
 *     with already-tracked fixtures) — the actual user lives in the identity
 *     provider (Pocket ID). `purgeFixturesFor` calls `keycloak.deleteUser(rowId)`
 *     (the `keycloak` alias now points at `../identity`) for these.
 *   - `tickets.tickets` is rare but valid (a seed module may insert a bug-
 *     ticket fixture; see `coaching-project.ts`). Has `is_test_data`.
 *   - `questionnaire_assignments` has `is_test_data`.
 *   - `customers` and `meetings` do NOT have `is_test_data`. The seed modules
 *     unconditionally insert these rows for the test only, so deleting by id
 *     alone is safe. See booking-flow.ts / coaching-project.ts.
